# How to Make Your AI Projects Succeed: Expert Recommendations

*Based on RAND Corporation Research Report RRA2680-1*

---

With AI project failure rates exceeding 80%, organizations need actionable strategies to improve their odds of success. RAND Corporation researchers synthesized insights from 65 experienced data scientists and engineers to develop practical recommendations for both industry and academia.

## Recommendations for Industry Leaders

### 1. Ensure Technical Staff Understand the Project Purpose

**Misunderstandings and miscommunications about the intent and purpose of the project are the most common reasons for AI project failure.**

Bridge the gap between business stakeholders and technical teams. Invest time upfront to ensure everyone shares a common understanding of:
- The business problem being solved
- The domain context and constraints
- Success criteria and expected outcomes

### 2. Choose Enduring Problems

**AI projects require time and patience to complete.**

Before beginning any AI project, leaders should be prepared to commit each product team to solving a specific problem for **at least a year**. Quick wins are rare in AI — sustainable success comes from long-term commitment to important problems.

### 3. Focus on the Problem, Not the Technology

**Successful projects are laser-focused on the problem to be solved, not the technology used to solve it.**

Resist the temptation to adopt the latest AI trends. Instead:
- Start with a clear problem statement
- Select technology that fits the problem
- Measure success by problem resolution, not technical sophistication

### 4. Invest in Infrastructure

**Up-front investments in infrastructure can reduce the time required to complete AI projects and increase the volume of high-quality data available.**

Build robust infrastructure to support:
- **Data governance** — ensuring data quality, accessibility, and compliance
- **Model deployment** — enabling smooth transitions from development to production
- **MLOps practices** — maintaining models effectively over time

### 5. Understand AI's Limitations

**When considering a potential AI project, leaders need to include technical experts to assess the project's feasibility.**

Not every problem should be solved with AI. Before committing resources:
- Involve technical experts in early feasibility assessments
- Honestly evaluate whether AI is the right tool
- Consider alternative approaches when appropriate

## Recommendations for Academia

### Partner with Government for Data Access

**Partnerships between academia and government agencies could give researchers access to data of the provenance needed for academic research.**

Data scarcity is a significant barrier to AI research. Strategic partnerships can unlock valuable datasets while maintaining appropriate governance.

### Expand Practitioner Doctoral Programs

**Computer science and data science program leaders should learn from disciplines like international relations, where practitioner doctoral programs often exist.**

Creating pathways for practitioners to engage in research helps:
- Apply academic findings to urgent real-world problems
- Bring practical experience into academic settings
- Accelerate the translation of research into impact
