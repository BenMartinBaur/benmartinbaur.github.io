**Visual Suggestion:** 
Create an infographic showing "5 Root Causes of AI Failure" as a downward spiral or warning signs, with a contrasting upward arrow showing "Path to Success" with the 5 recommendations.

🚨 **80% of AI Projects Fail — Here's Why Yours Doesn't Have To**

RAND Corporation researchers interviewed 65 data scientists and engineers to find out why AI projects fail at twice the rate of other IT projects.

The #1 reason? It's not the technology.

**It's miscommunication.**

Teams often don't share a common understanding of what problem they're actually solving.

Here are the 5 root causes they uncovered:

❌ Misunderstanding the problem to be solved  
❌ Lacking sufficient training data  
❌ Chasing shiny new tech instead of solving real problems  
❌ Inadequate infrastructure for deployment  
❌ Applying AI to problems that are simply too hard for it  

The good news? Each of these is preventable.

The researchers also developed actionable recommendations — like committing to problems for at least a year and investing in data infrastructure before diving into model development.

I've broken down the full findings into two posts:
📌 Part 1: The 5 Root Causes of AI Failure
📌 Part 2: Expert Recommendations for Success

**What's the biggest barrier to AI success you've seen in your organization?**
