## Introduction

We all love one-pagers to see all features directly on one page and that was the idea for the Remote Desktop client for Windows – Quick Start Guide.

We visualized the options and features of the Remote Desktop client / Azure Virtual Desktop client on two one-pagers.

Feel free to use and share this Quick Start Guide, and if you miss something, feel free to give us your feedback.

## Quick Start Guide

**Page one** shows how to subscribe to an AVD workspace in the Remote Desktop client for Windows.

**Page two** shows all options and functions if you have subscribed to an AVD workspace.

You can download the Quick Start Guide from the [AVDPunks GitHub repository](https://github.com/avdpunks/public/blob/main/AVD_QuickStartGuide_v1.0.pdf)!
