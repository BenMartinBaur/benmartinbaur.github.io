## Windows Cloud

W365 - is a cloud-based service that delivers a Windows Cloud PC from Microsoft Cloud for your end users. Each Cloud PC is assigned to an individual user and is their dedicated Windows device with a like-local experience. Windows 365 provides the productivity, security, and collaboration benefits of Microsoft 365.

AVD â€“ is a born-in-the-cloud cloud vdi (virtual desktop infrastructure) platform service offered entirely on our Microsoft Intelligent Cloud. All traditional infrastructure services such as brokering, web access, load balancer, management and monitoring are part of the AVD control plane and can be configured from the Azure portal, via the Azure Resource Manager (ARM), Biceps or Terraform.

DevBox - is an Azure service that gives developers self-service access to preconfigured, project-specific developer boxes. You can configure dev boxes with tools, source code, and prebuilt binaries that are specific to a project, so developers can immediately start work. You can create your own customized image, or use a preconfigured image from Azure Marketplace, complete with Visual Studio already installed.

## May RDP be with you!
